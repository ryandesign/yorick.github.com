Yorick
======

What is Yorick?
---------------

Yorick is an interpreted programming language for scientific
simulations or calculations, postprocessing or steering large
simulation codes, interactive scientific graphics, and reading,
writing, or translating large files of numbers. Yorick includes an
interactive graphics package, and a binary file package capable of
translating to and from the raw numeric formats of all modern
computers. Yorick is written in ANSI C and runs on most operating
systems (*nix systems, Windows, MacOS). For a short overview, see the
Linux Gazette and Unix review articles.

Yorick has a compact syntax, similar to C, but with array
operators. It is easily expandable through dynamic linking of C
libraries, allows efficient manipulation of arbitrary size/dimension
arrays, and offers extensive graphic capabilities.

Under construction
------------------

Yorick is in the process of moving.  The [yorick homepage at
sourceforge](http://yorick.sf.net) is much more complete.  The yorick
forum will remain at sourceforge, but the source code management has
moved to [github.com/dhmunro/yorick](http://github.com/dhmunro/yorick).
